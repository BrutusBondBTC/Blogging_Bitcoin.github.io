I listened to a non-bitcoin podcast a few months ago. It is of interest for the readers of this blog because he participated in the value 4 value model on fountain.fm. He said somethig I've never heard before, but resonated with me.  Ads pay the podcaster a certain number of pennies per download. Maybe it was a penny and a half per download. That's not the actual number, I just made it up, but it was somewhere in that ballpark.  Therefore, if a listener sends you 1,000 sats, it's as if that listener is worth 20X that of a listneer who is counted for ad revenue.  At the time, 1,000 sats was a quarter. Today, a thousand sats is 42cents.

When I **zap someone 1,000 sats**, I zap them 42 vents worth of value. I expect the value of those sats to go up, for sure, but it's a metric ass-load more than the amount a couple attentive ears that fast forward through ads are. Ads have become the defacto way of funding online content creators because the Internet did not have native money. We are gamed by algos tnat know the type of woman or man we are attracted to and **what political red buttons will piss us off the most and keep our eyeballs chained to the screen**. Why? To watch more ads.

A thousand sats is an important metric. This podcaster also said knowing the price of 1,000 sats makes it easy to calculate the "price of bitcoin" (a.k.a. 100,000,000 sats). What a silly measurement a hundred million sats is to compare to a dollar. In my stay huble and stack sats opinion, 1,000 sats is a better comparison to the dollar than 100,000,000 sats is to the dollar. 1,000 sats = 42 pennies. This means 1,000 sats are worth 42% of a dollar. So a hundred sats is worth almost a nickle again. You could send someone a fifty cent peace in the mail and who would know about it other than the person who sent it and the person who opened the envelope? I don't know, but a stamp costs 60 cents. When the price of 1,000 sats reaches 60 cents again, the price of 100,000,000 sats will reach $60,000. Normies will say, "Damn! I wish I would have bought bitcoin when it was under $20,000! I guess I'm too late now." I remember when a stamp was 42 cents. I remember when stamps were a quarter.  I don't look at the price of stamps these days and yell, "Damn! I should have bought stamps when the were 25 cents! I guess I'm too late now. **I better use carrier pigions**. 

A thousand sats is an easier number to work with. When I boght coffee with bitcoin the other day and it's like 100k sats, I know that it will cost me about $42.00 worth of my fiat bullshit pay. It was acvtually $38.00 last week.  That's the cool thing this podcaster pointed out. If you know the price of 1,000 sats is a quarter:

- 10,000 sats = $2.50
- 100,000 sats == $25.00
- 1,000,000 sats == $250.00
- 10,000,000 sats = $2,500
- 100,000,000 sats = $25,000

Of course, it's easier for most people to calculate the price when the price of a thousand sats is 25 cents.  if that's how you feel, that's okay.  Calculate it that way. If I know a million sats at 25 cents per thousand sats is 250 bucks I can find the actual price by switching the first two digits with the actual price of 1,000 sats.  At 42 cents, a million sats is $420.00.  That's an easy number to remember, even and especiallly if you're a pot head, but if 1,000 sats was 38 cents like it was last week, the price of a million sats would be $380 bucks.
