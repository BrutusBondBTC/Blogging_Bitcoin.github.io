Story - Get On Nostr With Get Alby
author: Blogging Bitcoin
description: Nostr is a new communications protocol we can use to do interesting things with public key cryptography. It is not a cryptocurrency, does not have a CEO, or Stock shares, but we can use it for things like social media and much more. In this blog I teach you how to get on it using getalbyimage:

I made a video about the current app to show you how to make a nostr key on a cell phone. This app is easy, and it does give you a lightning address, but it's limited to one app while the Alby extension is interoperable with a multitude of clients like primal.net, habla.news, flockstr and hundreds more. This is great because passwords suck. My password manager has thousands of entries by now. It's a pain in the ass to use at this point. First, I wait for the site to load on Tor which is not the fastest browser in the world. Then I enter my password, search for the site, copy the user name, paste the username, copy the password, paste the password and finally click the button.

With Alby you login with your nostr key so you only need to type in your password once per session. There"s no reason to sign up for an account or five anybody else your email.

It's easy to get started, but allows advanced users to connect it to their own node. In the following video, I will show you how to:

Create an Alby Account

Create a personalized lightning address

Recover a nostr key using your 12 word backup

Create your profile

Login to several nostr sites with the click of a button.

By the end of the video, you'll know how to set up a nostr key and be ready to receive sats on the Internet. But wait...There's more. Most clients try to re-create the Xwitter experience without the corporate/government censorship complex, but it's a communication protocol, not a platform. Nostr is more akin to html than Xwitter. Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Meetup.com, Linktree, Substack, Medium, forms, gmail, Firefox, Pinterst, eBay,TikTok and morr. There is a version of all of these on the nostr protocol and they are censorship resistant.
