# Getting Started With Nostr

![spring browser](https://i.nostr.build/0kl9.png)

I've started making video turorials on nostr. For the record, this blog post will be posted on my website, as well any client that renders markdown files from kind 30024 blog posts.  If you're already a nostrnaut, please share this to onboard more people onto nostr. 

Nostr is a communications protocol, notes and other stuff transmitted by relay. Most people use this protocol for [microblogging](https://primal.net), but it is [so much more](https://github.com/aljazceru/awesome-nostr). Nostr is away to create a [blog](https://habla.news/p). You can also use it as a [decentralized marketplace](https://plebeian.market/), [group chat](https://satellite.earth/), a [twitterspaces like experience](https://nostrnests.com/), [play chess](https://multichess.github.io/), [make lists](https://listr.lol/), a [Pinterist](https://pinstr.app/), [Instagram](https://nostrgram.co/?build=626), [hosting a website](https://nostrsites.com/), [quote anything on the Internet](https://highlighter.com/), photo hosting, and a bunch of other stuff. None of these require an email, with maybe the exception of plebian.market as a backup way for people to contact each other when they buy stuff using bitcoin.  If you have Apple, you can use [Primal](https://primal.net/) for a microblogging experience and if you have an android, you can use the [Spring Browser](https://spring.site/) to find many of the apps on nostr.

## Why Nostr?

Nostr is freedom tech. By that, I mean it is censorship resistant and people are free to post whatever they want on it. Compare that to centralized legacy social media. You are not free to post what you want. You are not free to choose what to see. You are shown whatever is most likely to keep you enraged because pissed off people stay on the platform and watch more ads. Social media may be free of charge, but it is not free. You pay with the scarcest thing you own, your time and attention.  They also censor people for various reasons I won't get into because I don't care all that much about politics, but I will say this: I consider the nostr to be a version of the first amendment on the Internet. Rothbard makes devent arguments about how the freedom of speech is not really protected by the first amendment because you are not allowed to give a speech at a movie theatre during a movie, but nostr allows you to do just that. 

- **Everyone is free to say and publish what they want**. 

- **Everyone is free to block or mute whomever they want**.

- Some clients only filter content with less than 120 characters.

- Some clients only show notes with photos. 

This means you can go to one client for old school style tweets and another client for an Instagram experience. These can be whittled down into more specific niches as well. For example, you can read this blog on habla.news or blogstack.io, but not on nostr.cooking. Nostr.cooking is a blogging client, but focused only on recipes. It filters out blog posts that do not follow a specific format, recipes for cooking. Nobody called the FBI and told nostr.cooking they need to kick everyone writing a blog about bitcoin off the Internet. They just don't show any of my blogs on a client focused on perfecting their Iron Chef skills. I can still write my blog and it will show up on other clients. That's what freedom should look like.  

We can't say, we need free speech for everyone at all times in meat space. Rothbard was right, you really can't have people make a speech in the middle of Jaws. Online however, this is not a problem. It's just a matter of being free to focus on whatever you want. Nostr.cooking is a rather benign example, but in the future I could see a client that broadcasts Christian Church Services all day long and another client that shows only Donkey covered in Whip cream porn. That's what I mean by freedom tech. Everyone is free to publisn, but not everyone will see what you publish. No one is in control of the public commons, and people are free to choose which clients they want to use. There is no lock in. It reminds me of an online version of the book, [The Machinary of Freedom](https://highlighter.com/e/nevent1qqsp575nxqz956j5a7az4mkda7344ysn8uxq34a4h25k2zfw2tu0e5cpzdmhxue69uhk7enxvd5xz6tw9ec82c30qgs8t0er2vdwn7vvv2v4hgr3j8jg36k5wkt4xuwk847l634auxl639gzxasqn).

### To Get On Nostr

You will first need a nostr key. WTF is that? Without boring you with boring mathy stuff, it's 12 words. All you need to do is store 12 words. If you drop your phone in a swimming pool, you can recreate your nostr identity with those twelve words. It's like magic and that's all you really need to know.

You can also create a key using the Currnent App if you don't have a computer.
