Highlighter.com is a nostr microapp that allows.users to quote text from an article on Medium, Substack, random WordPress blog, or just about any form of text you can find on the Inter Tubes. The quote shows up as a nostr event, like this. These quotes get shares on other nostr apps like Amethyst. You can also:

*   Add the npub of an author

*   Get zapped for your curation.

*   Set up prisms that split the zaps between you and the author.

![highlighter.com](https://i.nostr.build/3ogk.png)This micro app is another Pablo7z creation, the most prolific nostr developer in the world. Tony jas written an article about it before here, but there's a new update I am excited about: subscriptions.

For a while, I added my blog to Substack because I wanted a way for people to subscribe to my work to see when I write.a new blogpost. Substack has fiat payment rails, but I'm not interested in fiat for ideological reasons. Don't get me wrong, I still use it to pay bills when I have to, but I want to get paid in bitcoin.

Highlighter.com has now added this feature. You can now **subscribe to people on highlighter.com. **This has been a dream of mine since 2018.  It's why I started writing in the first place.  My original idea was to write for satoshis, but that has now morphed into the value 4 value model.  Now, subscribers can pay anyone on nostr without going through a middle man.  **No more permission needed from Patreon.**  That's a big deal. **I remember when a government banned a bunch of bank accounts for sending bitcoin to truckers protesting vaccination without representation( or consent).**&#x20;

Highlighter was already one of my favorite nostr apps. I want to see more curated highlighters get onboarded, but subscriptions are hot digity-damn awesome. It even shuffles different blogs I have written to showcase things I wrote in the past. It's so good, I can't find the words to explain it so I created a video to show everyone how cool this is.

Onward,
